# Environment Setup Instructions

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the development environment for the Healthcare Connect project. Follow these steps to ensure you have all the required tools and dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): The JavaScript runtime for executing applications.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager): Used to install and manage project dependencies.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): A NoSQL database for data storage.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): Version control system for managing project code.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.

3. Run the following command to clone the project repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    ```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

4. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd healthcare-connect
    ```

5. Install the project's dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

6. Create a .env file in the project root directory.

7. Add the necessary environment variables to the .env file. These variables may include:

    ```env
    DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/healthcare_connect
    SECRET_KEY=mysecretkey
    ```

    Replace the values with your specific configuration.

## Step 4: Start the Development Server

8. Start the development server with the following command:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will launch the application on a local development server.

9. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to access the application.

## Step 5: Database Setup

10. Ensure your MongoDB server is running.

11. Use a MongoDB client or command line to create the necessary databases and collections as specified in the project's documentation.
